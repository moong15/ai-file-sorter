# Configuration and Environment

This page collects the configuration surfaces that are most useful for
contributors, packagers, and integrators. The main README can stay focused on
normal setup and usage.

## Local settings and storage

- `config.ini` lives under the app config directory.
- `AI_FILE_SORTER_CONFIG_DIR` overrides the base config directory.
- `AI_FILE_SORTER_LLM_STORAGE_DIR` overrides where downloaded local model files
  are stored.
- `AI_FILE_SORTER_LLM_DIR` is the legacy alias for
  `AI_FILE_SORTER_LLM_STORAGE_DIR`.
- `CATEGORIZATION_CACHE_FILE` overrides the categorization SQLite filename
  inside the config directory.

## Runtime backend selection

- The Windows and Linux launchers support `--cuda={on|off}` and
  `--vulkan={on|off}`.
- `AI_FILE_SORTER_GPU_BACKEND` selects `auto`, `cuda`, `vulkan`, or `cpu`.
- `AI_FILE_SORTER_N_GPU_LAYERS` overrides llama.cpp GPU offload selection.
- `AI_FILE_SORTER_CTX_TOKENS` overrides local LLM context length.
- `AI_FILE_SORTER_GGML_DIR` points to a custom ggml runtime directory when the
  packaged/default discovery path is not the right one.

## Visual-model configuration

- `LLAVA_MODEL_URL` and `LLAVA_MMPROJ_URL` override the built-in LLaVA download
  URLs.
- `GEMMA3_4B_MODEL_URL` and `GEMMA3_4B_MMPROJ_URL` override the built-in Gemma
  visual-model download URLs.
- `AI_FILE_SORTER_VISUAL_USE_GPU=0` forces the visual encoder to stay on CPU.

## Timeouts, pacing, and logs

- `AI_FILE_SORTER_LOCAL_LLM_TIMEOUT`
- `AI_FILE_SORTER_REMOTE_LLM_TIMEOUT`
- `AI_FILE_SORTER_CUSTOM_LLM_TIMEOUT`
- `AI_FILE_SORTER_REMOTE_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`
- `AI_FILE_SORTER_LLAMA_LOGS`

These knobs are most useful when diagnosing slow providers, rate-limited
providers, or local runtime issues.

## config.ini keys for concurrency

- `[Settings] LlmConcurrentRequests` sets how many LLM requests run in parallel:
  `1`, `2`, `4`, `6`, or `8` (default `1`). Other values round down to the
  nearest supported level, and values below 1 become `1`. It applies to ChatGPT
  and custom OpenAI-compatible text requests. Gemini and local GGUF models always
  run one request at a time. Each in-flight request counts against
  `AI_FILE_SORTER_CUSTOM_LLM_TIMEOUT`, including server queue time.

## Headless setting overlays

Headless callers can pass `--settings-overrides-file <json-file>` to inject a
non-persistent settings overlay for one run. This is the preferred way to steer
integration-specific behavior without rewriting the user's saved settings.

## Windows naming and migration note

New registry/settings/integration paths should use `HFStudio`. Compatibility
code may still need to read or clean legacy `Quicknode` locations during
migration or uninstall flows.
