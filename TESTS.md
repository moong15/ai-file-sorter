# Test Suite Guide

This document provides a detailed description of every test case in the project. It is organized by test file and mirrors the intent, setup, procedure, and expected outcomes for each case. All unit tests live under `tests/unit`. UI-centric tests use a headless Qt platform plugin so they can run without a visible display: `minimal` on Windows and `offscreen` on other platforms.

## How to run tests
- Configure tests on Linux/macOS (once): `cmake -S app -B build-tests -DAI_FILE_SORTER_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DAI_FILE_SORTER_REQUIRE_MEDIAINFOLIB=ON`
- Build and run all tests on Linux/macOS: `cmake --build build-tests` then `ctest --test-dir build-tests --output-on-failure -j $(nproc)`
- On Windows, configure from a Visual Studio Developer PowerShell with the vcpkg toolchain and a Qt 6 MSVC kit, for example: `$env:VCPKG_ROOT="D:\path\to\vcpkg"; $qt="C:\Qt\6.6.3\msvc2019_64"; $toolchain=Join-Path $env:VCPKG_ROOT "scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake"; cmake -S app -B build-tests -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$qt "-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$toolchain" -DVCPKG_MANIFEST_DIR=app -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows -DAI_FILE_SORTER_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DAI_FILE_SORTER_REQUIRE_MEDIAINFOLIB=ON`
- On Windows, build and run all tests with: `cmake --build build-tests --config Release --target ai_file_sorter_tests ai_file_sorter_updater_notify_only_tests ai_file_sorter_updater_disabled_tests --parallel $env:NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS` then `ctest --test-dir build-tests -C Release --output-on-failure -j $env:NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS`
- Run a single test case by name: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "<test case name or pattern>"`
- On Windows multi-config builds, the direct test executable lives under `./build-tests/tests/<Config>/`, for example: `./build-tests/tests/Release/ai_file_sorter_tests.exe "<test case name or pattern>"`
- Run GUI test mode: `./build-tests/aifilesorter --test`
- Run production-binary self-tests: `./build-tests/aifilesorter --self-test` or `./build-tests/aifilesorter --self-test=whitelist`
- Register optional live LLM headless tests by adding `-DAI_FILE_SORTER_ENABLE_LIVE_LLM_TESTS=ON` when configuring tests, or on Windows by running `.\app\build_windows.ps1 -Configuration Release -Variants Standard -BuildTests -EnableLiveLlmTests` in PowerShell or `app\build_windows.cmd -Configuration Release -Variants Standard -BuildTests -EnableLiveLlmTests` in `cmd.exe`. Then either set `AI_FILE_SORTER_LIVE_LLM_MODEL` to a local text GGUF path or rely on the selected local/custom GGUF in AI File Sorter `config.ini`, optionally set `AI_FILE_SORTER_LIVE_BACKEND=cpu|cuda|vulkan|auto` (`cuda` validates CUDA explicitly; `cpu` is for deterministic CPU/OpenBLAS runs), and run `ctest --test-dir build-tests -L live-llm --output-on-failure` for manual CMake builds or `ctest --test-dir app\build-windows -C Release -L live-llm --output-on-failure` for the Windows helper build. Use `ctest -V` for live progress; otherwise tail the work dir from `%TEMP%\aifs-live-llm-latest.txt`. Image rename cases also require `AI_FILE_SORTER_LIVE_VISUAL_MODEL` and `AI_FILE_SORTER_LIVE_VISUAL_MMPROJ`, unless a custom visual model pair is selected in settings.
- If Windows CMake reports a missing Visual Studio instance from an existing `build-tests` directory, use `cmake --fresh` when supported, delete/recreate that build directory, or choose a new build directory; the Visual Studio path is stored in `CMakeCache.txt`.
- MediaInfo is expected from a package manager (`apt`/`dnf`/`pacman`/`brew`/`vcpkg`); vendored MediaInfo directories/binaries are intentionally rejected by the build.

## App test modes

The production executable supports two developer-oriented test modes:

- `--test` launches the normal GUI, implies development mode, and adds a Tests menu. The current GUI preset creates a larger sample whitelist and sample files, then runs the normal analysis flow with the selected real LLM for manual review in the Review dialog. It reuses the user's selected LLM settings, but test-mode whitelists, categorization cache, learned behavior, undo data, and sample files are stored under an isolated `test_mode_profile` directory inside the normal config directory.
- `--self-test` runs deterministic headless checks and exits with a pass/fail status. The current suite is `whitelist`, which builds large synthetic whitelists in a temporary config directory and verifies compact prompt candidate selection, learned-category preference, and Unicode whitelist labels. `--self-test` runs all available suites; `--self-test=whitelist` and `--self-test=whitelists` select only the whitelist suite.

## Optional live LLM headless tests

`tests/live_llm/headless_live_llm_tests.py` is an opt-in black-box integration suite. It runs the production `aifilesorter --headless` command against isolated copies of real/generated files, seeds a temporary app config with a custom local text model, writes a persisted test whitelist, and validates the emitted status/review JSON plus filesystem effects. The explicit `--model` / `AI_FILE_SORTER_LIVE_LLM_MODEL` value wins; if omitted, the runner reads AI File Sorter `config.ini` and uses the selected local/custom GGUF when it can resolve the file. On bundled Windows builds it uses the `aifilesorter.exe` launcher, or auto-promotes a supplied `aifilesorter-bin.exe` path to the sibling launcher, so llama.cpp backend DLL selection matches the non-Store app. The runner emits per-case progress, writes `progress.log`, and includes runtime backend fields from the headless status JSON. The suite exits with `77` when the required executable or usable text model path is missing so CTest reports it as skipped rather than failed.

Covered cases include categorization with and without subcategories, whitelist-restricted categorization, selected-file auto-apply boundaries, document renaming in English/French/Simplified Chinese/Hindi, optional image-content renaming in the same languages when visual artifacts are configured, a FLAC metadata rename capability probe, and categorize-and-rename review-plan generation. Exact model labels are not treated as golden output; assertions focus on stable invariants such as non-empty categories, whitelist confinement, extension preservation, and review-plan creation. Non-English rename language/script signals are warning-only by default; set `AI_FILE_SORTER_LIVE_REQUIRE_LOCALIZED_RENAMES=1` for strict localized rename failures.

Run directly with: `python tests/live_llm/headless_live_llm_tests.py --app app\build-windows\Release\aifilesorter.exe --model C:\models\text-model.gguf --backend cpu --keep-work-dir --verbose`. See `tests/live_llm/README.md` for all environment variables and public fixture sources.

Manual Windows GUI smoke validation for issue #95: launch a normal visible build, switch the UI/category language to French, scan a folder containing non-CP1252 filenames, open the Review dialog, sort columns, toggle subcategory visibility, change UI language while the dialog is open, apply `Logiciels / Navigateur`, and undo. Expected outcome: no `Qt6Widgets.dll` crash, no Windows code-page path exception, no literal `subcategory` folder, and the file is restored by undo.

Expected outcome: At least one top-level category-language menu entry is a submenu, confirming the expanded list is compartmentalized.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "Full Gemma 3 category language menus are compartmentalized into submenus"`

#### Test case: Selecting a submenu-backed category language does not rebuild menus synchronously
Purpose: Prevent submenu-backed category-language selections from destroying the active Qt menu tree during the `triggered` signal, which previously caused Windows crashes inside `Qt6Widgets.dll`.
Setup: Build `MainApp` with offscreen Qt in a temporary config directory and switch settings to `Local_4b_Gemma` so the category-language menu is grouped into submenus.
Procedure: Refresh the category-language menu, locate the submenu that contains `French`, trigger that action directly, and process the queued Qt events.
Expected outcome: The selected category language changes to French, the original parent submenu remains alive for the duration of the trigger handler, and the rebuilt menu still exposes `French` as the checked choice after queued events run.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "Selecting a submenu-backed category language does not rebuild menus synchronously"`

#### Test case: Repeated category language switching keeps submenu-backed menus stable
Purpose: Exercise the crash-prone Windows menu lifetime path by repeatedly opening/closing the grouped category-language menu and switching between English, French, and German.
Setup: Build `MainApp` with headless Qt in a temporary config directory and switch settings to `Local_4b_Gemma` so the category-language menu is grouped into submenus.
Procedure: Loop 20 times, show and hide the category-language menu, trigger the next language action, process queued menu refresh events, and locate the rebuilt checked action.
Expected outcome: No submenu pointer is destroyed during the trigger handler, settings track the selected language, and the rebuilt menu keeps the selected action checked after every iteration.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "Repeated category language switching keeps submenu-backed menus stable"`

### `tests/unit/test_ui_translator.cpp`

#### Test case: UiTranslator updates menus, actions, and controls
Purpose: Validate that the UI translator updates all primary controls, menus, and stateful labels in a consistent pass, including category-language actions now generated from the expanded catalog.
Setup: Build a test harness with a `QMainWindow`, many UI controls, a full interface-language action group that now includes Hindi, Simplified Chinese, Swedish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Finnish, Danish, and Korean, plus a generated category-language action array covering the expanded catalog, and a translator state set to French in settings. Use a translation function that returns the input string to test label wiring rather than actual translation files.
Procedure: Call `retranslate_all()` and verify the text of buttons, checkboxes, top-level menus, language menus, representative category-language actions, status labels, and the file explorer dock title. Also verify the interface-language menu is re-sorted alphabetically and the language action group selection stays correct.
Expected outcome: All UI elements show the expected English strings, including File/Edit/View, the interface/category language menus, the `Reset learned behavior…` and `Clear cache…` Settings actions, representative category-language labels such as `Hindi`, `Japanese`, `Simplified Chinese`, and `Traditional Chinese`, the interface-language menu is alphabetized, and the French language action is marked checked, demonstrating the retranslate pipeline is correctly wired.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "*UiTranslator updates menus*"`

Procedure: Run `CategorizationService::categorize_entries` and read the instance count and shared-client violation count.
Expected outcome: All files are categorized, between 1 and 4 client instances are created, and no shared-client violations are recorded.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "Concurrent categorization creates one client per slot, not per file"`

#### Test case: Concurrent categorization commits results and completions in input order
Purpose: Verify that results and completion callbacks follow input order even when replies arrive in reverse order.
Setup: Configure concurrency 4 with four files named `order_a.txt` to `order_d.txt`; their probe delays are 300, 200, 100, and 10 ms, so they finish in reverse order. The completion and result callbacks record file names.
Procedure: Run `CategorizationService::categorize_entries` with both callbacks.
Expected outcome: The returned list, the result callback sequence, and the completion callback sequence all list `order_a` through `order_d` in that order.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "Concurrent categorization commits results and completions in input order"`

#### Test case: Concurrent categorization failure reports once, does not duplicate completions, and propagates
Purpose: Ensure a failed request is reported once, the exception reaches the caller, and completions are not duplicated.
Setup: Configure concurrency 4 with four files; the probe throws a `runtime_error` for `fail_b.txt`, and each request takes 80 ms.
Procedure: Run `CategorizationService::categorize_entries` and expect `std::runtime_error`; inspect the call count, completion callbacks, and progress messages.
Expected outcome: The exception is rethrown; all four requests in the chunk were started; only `fail_a.txt` is recorded as completed; exactly one progress message contains `[LLM-ERROR]`.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "Concurrent categorization failure reports once, does not duplicate completions, and propagates"`

#### Test case: Concurrent categorization honours stop: no new requests, no deadlock, unique completions
Purpose: Verify that setting the stop flag during a run prevents new requests, the run finishes without deadlock, and each file completes at most once.
Setup: Configure concurrency 4 with 24 file entries; each request takes 150 ms, and the stop flag is set once four requests have started.
Procedure: Run `CategorizationService::categorize_entries` and inspect the call count and completion callbacks.
Expected outcome: Fewer than 24 requests are made but at least 4; all completion names are unique; the number of returned results does not exceed the number of completions.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "Concurrent categorization honours stop: no new requests, no deadlock, unique completions"`

#### Test case: Concurrent categorization calls the client on the worker thread without spawning a helper thread
Purpose: Verify that concurrent categorization reuses worker threads: the coordinator thread always serves the first client, and the number of distinct calling threads is bounded by the chunk count rather than one thread per request.
Setup: Configure concurrency 2 with six files. A thread-recording client records which thread entered each client instance; each request sleeps 20 ms.
Procedure: Run `CategorizationService::categorize_entries` and inspect the call count, the instance count, and the recorded thread ids.
Expected outcome: Six calls are made across two client instances; instance 0 is entered by only one thread; the number of distinct calling threads is at most 1 plus the three chunks of two files, so no detached thread is started per request.
Run: `./build-tests/ai_file_sorter_tests "Concurrent categorization calls the client on the worker thread without spawning a helper thread"`
